# Task Tracking System

This document explains how tasks and project plans are organized in this Laravel blog project.

## 📁 File Organization

### Main Task Files (Project Root)

- **`TASKS.md`** - Primary task tracking file with current and future tasks
- **`PROJECT-IMPROVEMENTS.md`** - Detailed improvement suggestions with code examples
- **`TASK-TRACKING.md`** - This file, explaining the task organization system

### Development Rules (`.trae/rules/`)

The `.trae/rules/` directory contains development guidelines and standards:

- `00-index.md` - Overview of all rules
- `01-fluxui-comprehensive-guide.md` - FluxUI implementation guide
- `02-fluxui-performance-accessibility.md` - Performance and accessibility guidelines
- `03-fluxui-design-patterns.md` - Design pattern standards
- `04-coding-standards.md` - Code quality standards
- `05-qa-testing-pipeline.md` - Testing and QA guidelines
- `06-laravel-project-guidelines.md` - Laravel-specific guidelines
- `07-flux-ui-integration.md` - FluxUI integration patterns
- `08-route-parameter-guidelines.md` - Routing standards
- `09-fluxui-demo-patterns.md` - Demo implementation patterns

## 🎯 Task Management Workflow

### 1. Current Tasks
All active and completed tasks are tracked in `TASKS.md` with:
- ✅ Completed tasks (marked as done)
- 🔥 High priority tasks (immediate attention)
- 🟡 Medium priority tasks (next sprint)
- 🟢 Low priority tasks (future)

### 2. Task Planning
When planning new features or improvements:
1. Review `TASKS.md` for current priorities
2. Check `PROJECT-IMPROVEMENTS.md` for detailed implementation guidance
3. Follow guidelines in `.trae/rules/` for implementation standards
4. Update `TASKS.md` with progress

### 3. Implementation Guidelines
- **Start Small**: Implement one improvement at a time
- **Test Everything**: Write tests before and after changes
- **Follow Conventions**: Use existing project patterns
- **Document Changes**: Update task files as you progress
- **Monitor Impact**: Measure performance before and after changes

## 📋 Task Status Indicators

- ✅ **Completed**: Task is fully implemented and tested
- 🔥 **High Priority**: Needs immediate attention
- 🟡 **Medium Priority**: Important but not urgent
- 🟢 **Low Priority**: Nice to have, future consideration
- [ ] **Pending**: Not yet started
- 🚧 **In Progress**: Currently being worked on

## 🔄 Regular Maintenance

### Weekly Reviews
- Review completed tasks and mark them as done
- Assess priority levels and adjust as needed
- Add new tasks discovered during development
- Update progress on ongoing tasks

### Monthly Planning
- Review overall project direction
- Reassess priorities based on business needs
- Plan upcoming sprints
- Archive completed major features
