- **Created**: Comprehensive `TEST_FIXING_GUIDE.md`
- **Documented**: Systematic approach to identifying and fixing test failures
- **Included**: Real-world examples from PostsIndexTest and PostsShowTest fixes
- **Covered**: Common patterns, debugging strategies, and verification processes

### Results Achieved
- ‚úÖ **85 tests passing** (204 assertions)
- ‚úÖ **Zero test failures** in complete test suite
- ‚úÖ **QA suite passing**: Pest, Pint, and PHPStan all green
- ‚úÖ **Reliable CI/CD foundation** established
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive testing guide** for future development
